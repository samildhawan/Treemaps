# Treemaps

# Assignment Description:
A treemap is a visualisation technique to show a tree’s structure according to the weights (or sizes) of its data values. It uses rectangles to show subtrees, scaled to reflect the proportional sizes of each piece of data.
Trees are a fundamental data structure used to model hierarchical data. Often, a tree represents a hierarchical categorization of a base set of data, where the leaves represent the data values themselves, and internal nodes represent groupings of this data. Files on a computer can be viewed this way: regular files (e.g., PDF documents, video files, Python source code) are grouped into directories, which are then grouped into larger directories, etc.

Sometimes the data in a tree has some useful notion of size. For example, in a tree representing the departments of a company, the size of a node could be the dollar amount of all sales for that department, or the number of employees in that department. Or in a tree representing a computer’s file system, the size of a node could be the size of the file.
Treemaps are used in many contexts. Among the more popular uses are news headlines, various kinds of financial information, and computer disk usage. Some free programs use treemaps to visualize the size of files on your computer; for example:

WinDirStatLinks for Windows

Disk Inventory X for MacOS

KDirStat for Linux

In this assignment, I wrote an interactive treemap visualisation tool that we can use to visualize hierarchical data.
